# SwifUI & Combine

## About

__Imperative__: With imperative programming, we‚Äôre directly telling the program (or app) what to do and how to do it.

You‚Äôre coding: ‚ÄúPut this button here, then download that piece of data, make a decision with if, and finally assign that value to a text label.‚Äù

__Declarative__: With declarative programming, we‚Äôre merely telling the program (or app) what to do, but not how.

We‚Äôre building the logic of a program, without describing its control flow. The actual implementation is up to the program or its frameworks.

## Combine Intro

__Combine = Publishers + Subscribers + Operators__

![Combine_I](Combine_I.png)

### Publisher

`Publisher` sends sequences of values over time to one or more `Subscribers`. 

A publisher can send values or terminate with either success or error. `Output` defines what kind of values a publisher can send. Failure defines the type of error it may fail with.

They can emit values over time. Those values are consumed by subscriber instances. In this way, a publisher can emit several events of the following types:
* The publisher‚Äôs output value, that‚Äôs a generic Output type.
* A successful completion
* An error completion. Failure type that it may publish.

These `Output` and `Failure` types are included in the protocol that a publisher conforms. Moreover note that a publisher can emit zero or more Output values but one completion. Once this is sent, publisher ends up its activity.

Apart from that, publisher implements the `receive(subscriber:)` method to connect with a subscriber. In other words, publisher‚Äôs output matches with subscriber‚Äôs input and the same for the failure types.

### Operators

Special methods declared on the publisher protocol that returns another publisher. They have input/output and error handling. Apart from that, they can be combined (üòâ) making operators chains to implement complex logic.

That way of creating and connecting asynchronous elements avoids having a shared state of data. That problem commented on previously.
Continue with the example of the Fibonacci publisher, we can have two operators that convert the `<Int, Error>` input into a` <String, Never>` output. That String could be the Fibonacci number and its representation (i.e. "F(8) = 21"):

### Subscriber

* Subscriber receives values from a publisher.

* A subscriber can receive a value of type `Input` or a termination event with either success or `Failure`.

* Any of these chains of publishers and operators end up with a subscriber. This receives those values. Combine provide two built-in subscribers:
    * `sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)` : Use os closures to handle elements received and completion events.
    * `assign(to:on:)` : Bind the element received in a property of your data model or on a UI control. That property is identified by a key path.

## Combine

### Combine Sample : Connecting Publisher to Subscriber

Combine has two built-in subscribers: `Subscribers.Sink` and `Subscribers.Assign`. You can connect them by calling either of these methods on a publisher :

* `sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)` to handle new element or completion event in a closure.
* `assign(to:on:)` to write new element to a property.

```swift
// 1
let publisher = Just(1)
// 2
publisher.sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in
    print("finished")
}, receiveValue: { value in
    print(value)
})
```

### Combine : `PassthroughSubject`

As in [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/passthroughsubject) : _A subject that broadcasts elements to downstream subscribers._

__Code Sample__

```swift
class Tab5_ViewRouter: ObservableObject {
    let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Tab5_ViewRouter, Never>() 
    var currentPage: Tab5Pages = .page1 {
        didSet {
            objectWillChange.send(self)
        }
    }
}
```

__Code Sample__

```swift
class SampleUserSettings: ObservableObject {
    let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
    @UserDefault("ShowOnStart", defaultValue: true)
    var showOnStart: Bool {
        willSet {
            objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }
}
```

---

### `CurrentValueSubject`

As on [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/currentvaluesubject) : _A subject that wraps a single value and publishes a new element whenever the value changes._

```swift
let var1 = CurrentValueSubject<[String], Never>([])
let var2 = CurrentValueSubject<Int, Never>(0)
let var3 = CurrentValueSubject<Date?, Never>(nil)

var1.sink { print("# var1 : \($0)") }.store(in: &subscriptions)
var2.sink { print("# var2 : \($0)") }.store(in: &subscriptions)
var3.sink { print("# var3 : \($0)") }.store(in: &subscriptions)

var1.send(["test", "test1"])
var2.send(1)
var3.send(Date())
```

---

### `@Published`

As on [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published) : _A type that publishes a property marked with an attribute._

@Published is one of the most useful property wrappers in SwiftUI, allowing us to create observable objects that automatically announce when changes occur.

SwiftUI will automatically monitor for such changes, and re-invoke the body property of any views that rely on the data. In practical terms, that means whenever an object with a property marked @Published is changed, all views using that object will be reloaded to reflect those changes.

__Code Sample__ : See @ObservableObjectClass section


## SwiftUI

### SwiftUI : `@State`

As in [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) : _A property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI._

It is local to the view. It has to be a value-type (e.g., a struct, Int, String, Array, etc) and its storage is managed by the framework.

__Code Sample__

```swift
@State private var isShowing: Bool = true 
var toggleView: some View {
    return Toggle(isOn: $isShowing) {
        if isShowing { Text("Toggle On") } 
        else { Text("Toggle Off") }
    }
}
```

__Considerations__

Note that `@State` variables are also great while prototyping your app. For example, if you are working on the layout of your view, you can initially use a `@State` variable to make things easier. Once your view does what you want, you can concentrate on creating your `@BindableObject` and replace your `@State`.

```swift
@Published var wasInitialized = false
@Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode
@ObservedObject var state = InitAnotherViewState()
@State var text = ""
```

---

### SwiftUI : `@Binding`

As stated on [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) : _A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of truth._

Use a binding to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. A binding connects a property to a source of truth stored elsewhere, instead of storing data directly. 

__Code Sample__

```swift
struct PlayButton: View {
    @Binding var bindingVar2: Bool
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: { self.bindingVar2.toggle() }) { Image(systemName: bindingVar2 ? "pause.circle" : "play.circle") }
    }
}

struct VisualDocs_Binding_I: View {
    @State private var bindingVar1: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            PlayButton(bindingVar2: $bindingVar1)
            if bindingVar1 {
                Text("isPlaying...")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI : `@EnvironmentObject`

As stated on [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject) : _A property wrapper type for an observable object supplied by a parent or ancestor view._

An EnvironmentObject is a data model which, once initialised, can share data to all view‚Äôs of your app. 

__Code Sample__

```swift
class ObservableObjectClass: ObservableObject {
    @Published var somePublishedVar = 0
}

struct ChangeView_VisualDocs_EnvironmentObject_I_Details_2: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var someEnvironmentObjectB: ObservableObjectClass
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Score: \(someEnvironmentObjectB.somePublishedVar)")
            Button("Tap Increase") { self.someEnvironmentObjectB.somePublishedVar += 1 }
        }
    }
}

struct ChangeView_VisualDocs_EnvironmentObject_I_Details_1: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var someEnvironmentObjectB: ObservableObjectClass
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Score: \(someEnvironmentObjectB.somePublishedVar)")
            Button("Tap Increase") { self.someEnvironmentObjectB.somePublishedVar += 1 }
        }
    }
}

struct VisualDocs_EnvironmentObject_I: View {
    @ObservedObject var someObservedObject = ObservableObjectClass()
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack(spacing: 30) {
                Text("Score: \(someObservedObject.somePublishedVar)")
                NavigationLink(destination: ChangeView_VisualDocs_EnvironmentObject_I_Details_1()) {
                    Text("Show Detail View 1")
                }
                NavigationLink(destination: ChangeView_VisualDocs_EnvironmentObject_I_Details_2()) {
                    Text("Show Detail View 2")
                }
            }
        }
        .environmentObject(someObservedObject)
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI : `@ObservedObject`

As on [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/ObservedObject) : _A property wrapper type that subscribes to an observable object and invalidates a view whenever the observable object changes._

It is external to the view, it is a reference value (e.g., a class) and its storage is managed by you, giving you more flexibility to implement your own logic.
